## Calendar & Scheduling System (2025 Architecture)

### Core Calendar Architecture 

**MongoDB-Cached Calendar System** - The primary calendar system using MongoDB for persistent, fast calendar data access:
- **CachedEventModel** (`src/server/models/CachedEvent.ts`) - MongoDB schema for all calendar events
- **CalendarSyncService** (`src/server/services/CalendarSyncService.ts`) - Background sync service for iCloud/Google calendars
- **CalendarCache React Context** (`src/client/lib/CalendarCache.tsx`) - React context for instant calendar access

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Initial load: ~10ms (MongoDB cached data)
- Background sync: 5-minute intervals with sync tokens
- Instant UI updates with optimistic updates
- Automatic calendar configuration application

### WeeklyCalendar Component (`src/client/components/WeeklyCalendar.tsx`)
- Professional calendar view with iCloud-style design
- **Current Implementation**: Uses `/api/merged/all` for unified iCloud+Google calendar data
- **Features**: Event hover states, overlapping event handling, business hours integration
- **Modals**: Integrates with DayEventsModal, ScheduleAppointmentModal, EventModal
- **Styling**: Professional black/white theme with proper contrast and typography

### Scheduling API Endpoints

**Primary Availability Endpoint**:
- `GET /api/availability?date=YYYY-MM-DD&duration=MINUTES&buffer=MINUTES`
	- **MongoDB-based** using CachedEventModel for instant response (~10-50ms)
	- **Calendar Configuration Aware** - only considers events from calendars marked as 'blocking'
	- **RRULE Expansion** - properly handles recurring events with RRULE expansion
	- **All-day Event Exclusion** - excludes all-day events from blocking appointments  
	- **UTC Storage/MT Business Hours** - events stored in UTC, compared against Mountain Time business hours
	- **Current Status**: ✅ Fixed and working correctly (returns 7 available slots for test dates)

**Calendar Management Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/calendar/schedule` - Schedule appointments (admin only, with overlap checking)
- `GET /api/cached/all` - Get all cached events (instant response with background sync)
- `POST /api/cached/sync/trigger` - Manual sync trigger (admin only)
- `POST /api/cached/sync/reset` - Force full calendar resync (admin only)

### Calendar Configuration System

**CalendarConfigModel** (`src/server/models/CalendarConfig.ts`)**:
- **busyCalendars**: Array of calendar URLs that should block appointment availability
- **calendarColors**: Object mapping calendar URLs to display colors
- **Applied During Sync**: CalendarSyncService now properly applies configuration during sync
- **Recent Fix**: Sync service was hardcoding `blocking: true` - now respects calendar configuration

**Configuration Management**:
- Admin interface at `/admin` allows toggling calendar busy/blocking status
- Color overrides supported for all calendars (iCloud and Google)
- Configuration changes trigger background resync to update cached events

Website theme: Black and White, Modern, Minamilistic, Luxury looking

This is how I want my website layout to be: [LINK]https://www.sagiagency.com/clutch/?utm_source=clutch.co&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=featured-listing-consulting-us

There should be
Free consultation:

Requiring:
Name
Email
Phone
Company
Website if applicable

Intake questionnaire (checkboxes/inputs):
Duns Number
Number of Subsidiaries if services needed for
Revenue approx
If they want bookkeeping services approximately how many transactions per month
If they want reconciliations, how many accounts?
Do they need assistance doing a financial clean up?
Do they need assistance with accounting software implementation?
What are their goals?
Do you need assistance creating a website yes/no?

Create a zoom scheduler that sets up meetings for these requested consultations automatically within my working hours (specified within hoursOfOperation.json) cross referenced with my personal calender & already scheduled appointments for available time slots, send an email notification to mayrconsultingservices@gmail.com, schedule a block on my personal calendar, and preferably send a SMS message notification. If they want to reach me by phone I will create google voice eventually.

Pricing guidelines do not include on website. I must give this because it all depends on the company and the services they requested dependant on their size. This site will probably need an admin interface so I can view sensitive company information without the fear of it being leaked.

For me: Pricing Guidelines

Small Business (<$2M revenue): Usually fewer than 10 employees, lower invoice/payment volume (<100 monthly), and basic reporting needs.

Mid-Tier ($2M–$20M revenue): 10–100 employees, higher transaction volume (100–500+ invoices/month), more complex reporting, may need multi-entity or consolidated financials.

DEPENDING ON THE INFORMATION THE CLIENT ANSWERED GIVE ME AN ESTIMATE OF THE COST AND A BREAKOWN OF ALL SERVICES NECESSARY, IDEALLY IT'D BE NICE TO ALSO HAVE AN ADMIN INTERFACE TO VIEW ALL THIS INFORMATION.

How to Present on Your Website
Instead of only listing hourly/monthly rates, bundle services into tiered packages:
Starter (Small Business Focus): Basic bookkeeping + reconciliations + monthly financials (DON'T DISPLAY PRICE BUT DEPENDING ON SERVICES NEEDED ESTIMATE $750–$1,200/month).

Growth (Mid-Tier Focus): Full bookkeeping + AR/AP outsourcing + advisory check-in (AGAIN DO NOT DISPLAY THE PRICE BUT DEPENDING ON SERVICES NEEDED ESTIMATE BETWEEN $2,000–$3,500/month).

Premium (CFO Lite): Everything in Growth + forecasting + KPI dashboards + quarterly strategy sessions (ONCE AGAIN, THIS IS INTERNAL, DO NOT DISPLAY THE PRICES TO THE CUSTOMER THIS IS TO DRAW PEOPLE IN NOT CLOSE A DEAL, BUT FOR ADMINS ESTIMATE AROUND $3,500–$5,000+/month DEPENDING ON SERVICES).

Professionalize this site, make it clean, interesting, and very helpful to the end user and additionally me as the admin.

## NOTE FOR EVERY EDIT
Make sure to keep this copilot-instructions.md file updated with any new reusable components, functions, or utilities you create. This will help maintain a comprehensive reference for future development and ensure consistency across the codebase. Always document the purpose, props, and usage of new components or functions clearly in this file. Continue to refine, consolidate and expand this document as is necessary as the project evolves, ensuring it remains a valuable resource for anyone working on the codebase.

When making edits or additions, consider how they fit into the overall architecture and design principles outlined in this document. Ensure that new code adheres to the established guidelines for maintainability, scalability, and user experience.

## Publishing Environment
This site will be deployed on netlify, this means 4096 characters of build environment variables, and a serverless environment, no shared values between requests, and no persistent storage except externally (in databases or locally or whatever). Ensure that the build is optimized and efficient to meet these constraints. Which leads me to the...

## Guidelines for ALL Code
Always prioritize writing proper, idiomatic, compilable & buildable code. When issues do arise, ensure you are addressing root causes of issues. Strive for clean, maintainable, and well-documented code that adheres to best practices. Do not half complete requests/responses, do not write comments to insert something later, you can note todos and things that need to be addressed, but always ensure that everything is done up to par is left half done or incomplete (e.g. //Paste rest of code here. "Here's my plan that aligns with exactly what you're asking, I don't need clarification, except to proceed" and then I say "proceed" or "yes" or "continue" and you go on a side tangent. "This will for sure fix it" when the actual BAD CODE is not addressed <- DO NOT DO THIS. Remember, my words first and foremost are the most important information for what I want. Remember that all bad code must be code first, meaning that there is always behavior that has been WRITTEN already if there are bugs or issues. Remember to complete requests). Ensure issues are addressed from their underlying cause -- not just symptoms, code must be well structured, maintainable, controllable with internal controls, and scalable.

This codebase is a modern web application using React, TypeScript, Vite for the frontend, and Express with TypeScript for the backend. It is structured as a monorepo with shared types and utilities ideally it should be built and ready to deploy on netlify. All code should be written in TypeScript and modern ES module syntax.

All components, styles, and API routes should be well written with DRY principles, in each request
search for appropriate places to reuse code, and enable refactoring and modularity. In a large codebase like this it is key to keep things clean and maintainable, as well as memorable and clear. It is easy to lose track of this so ensure that you are always on your A game when composing, planning, and writing. Always think about the future and how this code will be used and expanded upon.

Always answer every part of a request in full, I will guide you but use this document as your main guiding principles for how to complete requests, I will give you ideas but you must expand and elaborate upon them based upon the rules and relevant information in this document. Please keep this document updated as a documentation so reusable functions and components can be referenced in the future and items can easily be reused and are known about to be reused.

Styling should be minimal, clean, professional, sleek, stylish, modern, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, good to use. A bad design makes it hard for users to do anything on the site, they don't know where to look, what to click, and they often will leave before we can even propose anything. A good design makes it easy for users to do what they need to do, important and key information large and in a place they will look, good choices that allow them to know what they can click. This makes using the site much easier, they can acomplish their goal quickly and easily. Always think about the user experience and how to make it as smooth and seamless as possible.

Always plan your implementation with a clear todo list that addresses every aspect of my request, and then implement it in a clean and professional manner, you can ask for a reivew of the plan, but once a plan is in motion do not stop until the goal you understand is achieved. Always complete your entire todo list in full, do not leave anything out or a request half finished. Ensure that everything is done to the absolute best of your ability.

When errors are encountered, always fix them cleanly with functionality maintained, ensure you understand the context and what the code is trying to accomplish, you don't need to ask for permission to fix and don't be scared of breaking code as long as you ensure you are cleaning it up and fixing it.

When something like "there are build errors" or "there are runtime errors" or "the code doesn't work" is said, then repeat changing testing and validating until everything is fixed and working properly. Do not stop until everything is working properly. Always ensure that you are addressing the root cause of issues and continue to retest and iterate. Do not ask for my permission to run cleanups when you find issues, just do it. Always ensure that you are understanding what is going wrong comprehensively and fixing the root cause of the issue and not just its symptoms.

When making edits or additions, consider how they fit into the overall architecture and design principles outlined in this document. Ensure that new code adheres to the established guidelines for maintainability, scalability, and user experience and all features link into each other properly and are used repetedly when needed, the memory bank should assist as like a notepad for available functions and endpoints, ensure to keep this updated so you can pull upon if there is already a function that does this or if there is a way to slightly modify an existing function rather than writing a whole new block. Ensure the usage of helper and smaller functions that perform specific small tasks and and utilities when operations must be performed repetedly, use descriptive names, good comments, and the simplest correct logic least prone to errors and issues inside of functions [no race cases, no ten nested if statements, etc etc, ensure clean, READABLE, *MAINTAINABLE*, **GOOD** CODE]. Be careful of errors that arise and ensure to fix the error that is actually stated [if this is a good and the correct solve]. Use relative fetches, remember fetch("/api/...") => fetch("baseurl.com/api/...") according to fetch standard as long as you are fetching internally, just use the first option `fetch("/api/endpoint")` and it will work properly in both dev and production. Ensure that all code is written in TypeScript and modern ES module syntax.

### Testing & Authentication
The dev server will (or should) always run on http://localhost:4000. Please only use npm run dev to start/restart the server, it already kills any existing processes and then starts a new server which will write to the ./server.log file. Output from the server logs can be found in the server.log file. Be careful when restarting the dev server as the server.log is recreated each time npm run dev is ran. You have to run `npm run dev` as isBackground: true and subsequent curls as isBackground: true, ALWAYS, if possible clean up terminals but more importantly you need to make sure that the dev server doesn't get killed when you run curls or other commands.

When testing authenticated endpoints, you can use the `curl` command with the `-b cookie.txt` option to include the authentication cookie stored in `cookie.txt`. You can use the credentials  alexwaldmann2004@gmail.com and password Debletar29? to login and write the cookie to cookie.txt to authenticate any request that needs to be authenticated. When running testing commands, ensure to use `isBackground: true` for the dev server (ran with `npm run dev`), as well as `isBackground: true` for testing commands (curls, sleeps, whatever you want to do to test), but you need to ensure that terminals don't overlap and interfere with each other. If you need to restart the server you can just run `npm run dev` again, it will kill the old process and start a new one. If you need to stop the server you can just use ctrl+c in the terminal running it. When testing, ensure the information you need is recieved, when done with testing ensure to clean this up.

### Guidelines
Just know that the database is in UTC time, and the everything in the frontend should run on mountain time (the local timezone for this computer). Quick load times, good UX and UI, and snappy interactable helpful components are the name of the game. Ensure everything is linked together and works as one. Unified color scheme, consistent styling rules, across the entire site ensure great quality and high standards.

### Calendar Synchronization & Caching (Dec 2024 - Major Fixes)

**CalendarSyncService Improvements**:
- **Fixed Configuration Application**: Sync service now properly applies calendar configuration (blocking status, colors) from CalendarConfigModel during sync
- **iCloud Sync**: Uses CalDAV with proper RRULE expansion and timezone handling  
- **Google Sync**: Uses Google Calendar API with sync tokens for incremental updates
- **Configuration Awareness**: Both providers now check CalendarConfigModel for `busyCalendars` and `calendarColors` during sync
- **Event Storage**: Events stored with proper `blocking` and `color` properties based on calendar configuration

**Key Fix Applied (Dec 2024)**:
```typescript
// Before: Hardcoded blocking status
blocking: true

// After: Configuration-aware blocking status  
const config = await CalendarConfigModel.findOne();
const isBlocking = config?.busyCalendars?.includes(calendarUrl) || false;
blocking: isBlocking
```

**Availability Endpoint Optimization**:
- **Fixed Architecture**: Now uses MongoDB cache exclusively (~10-50ms response)
- **Proper Event Filtering**: `blocking: { $ne: false }` - only includes blocking events
- **RRULE Expansion**: Correctly expands recurring events for target date
- **Timezone Handling**: Events stored in UTC, compared against Mountain Time business hours
- **Result**: Now correctly returns 7 available slots instead of incorrectly showing 20+ slots

### Zoom Meeting Integration (Dec 2024)

**Purpose:**
Automatically create Zoom meetings when scheduling appointments, with proper cleanup to prevent orphaned meetings.

**Key Components:**

**1. ZoomService (`src/server/services/ZoomService.ts`)**
- **Server-to-Server OAuth authentication** using Account ID, Client ID, and Client Secret (updated from JWT)
- Creates meetings via Zoom REST API with automatic password generation
- Supports meeting deletion for cleanup
- Automatic token refresh with caching (60s buffer)
- Requires environment variables: `ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID`, `ZOOM_CLIENT_ID`, `ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET`

**2. Zoom API Routes (`src/server/routes/zoom.ts`)**
- `POST /api/zoom/create-meeting` - Create meeting (requires auth)
- `DELETE /api/zoom/meeting/:meetingId` - Delete meeting (requires auth)  
- `GET /api/zoom/status` - Check API configuration

**3. ScheduleAppointmentModal Integration**
- "Create Zoom" button generates meeting immediately (not on schedule)
- Meeting link auto-populates in Video Call Link field
- Modal cancellation automatically deletes unused Zoom meetings
- Meeting ID stored with appointment for future management

**4. Backend Storage**
- Zoom meeting ID stored as `X-ZOOM-MEETING-ID` custom property in iCal events
- Enables future meeting management and cleanup

**Setup Requirements:**
1. Create Zoom App at https://marketplace.zoom.us/develop/create
2. Choose "Server-to-Server OAuth" app type
3. Set scopes: `meeting:write`, `meeting:read`, `meeting:delete`
4. Get credentials from app and set environment variables:
   ```
   ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id_here
   ZOOM_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   ```

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Backend API implemented and tested
- ✅ Frontend UI integrated with auto-cleanup
- ✅ Meeting data stored with appointments
- ✅ Server-to-Server OAuth authentication working
- ✅ Production ready with configured credentials

**Usage Flow:**
1. User opens Schedule Appointment Modal
2. User selects date and time (or available slot)
3. User clicks "Create Zoom" button (only enabled when time is selected)
4. Zoom meeting created with actual appointment time and details
5. Video URL field populated with join link
6. User schedules appointment → meeting time already correctly set
7. If user cancels modal → meeting automatically deleted

**Recent Improvements (Dec 2024):**
- ✅ **Actual Scheduled Meetings**: Zoom meetings now created with the real appointment time instead of placeholder times
- ✅ **Smart UI**: "Create Zoom" button only enabled when date and time are selected
- ✅ **Better Feedback**: Shows scheduled time and meeting ID in success message
- ✅ **Validation**: Prevents creating meetings without proper appointment time selected

### Meetings Management System (Dec 2024)

**Purpose:**
Comprehensive meeting management interface for admins to view, manage, and control scheduled appointments with integrated Zoom functionality.

### MongoDB-Cached Calendar System with Sync Tokens (Dec 2024)

**Architecture Overview:**
Complete cache-first calendar system with MongoDB storage, sync token management, and instant React state updates. Designed for 0ms load times and minimal API calls.

**Core Components:**

**1. CachedEventModel (`src/server/models/CachedEvent.ts`)**
- MongoDB schema for storing all calendar events locally
- Supports iCloud, Google, and local events with unified interface  
- Includes soft delete, ETag tracking, and automatic cleanup (30-day TTL for deleted events)
- Indexed for fast queries: event identity, date ranges, sync timestamps, provider filtering

**2. SyncTokenModel (`src/server/models/SyncToken.ts`)**
- Tracks incremental sync state for each calendar (iCloud CalDAV sync-token, Google syncToken)
- Handles error backoff, sync scheduling, and prevents concurrent syncs
- Statistics tracking: event counts, sync duration, error rates
- Calendar-level enable/disable and status monitoring

**3. CalendarSyncService (`src/server/services/CalendarSyncService.ts`)**
- **Incremental sync**: Uses sync tokens to fetch only changed events since last sync
- **Parallel processing**: Syncs multiple calendars concurrently with rate limiting
- **Smart error handling**: Exponential backoff, automatic retry scheduling  
- **Background operation**: 5-minute intervals, doesn't block user requests
- **Provider support**: iCloud CalDAV sync-collection REPORT, Google Calendar API syncToken

**4. Cached API Router (`src/server/routes/cached.ts`)**
- **Instant responses**: Serves from MongoDB cache (typically <10ms)
- **Background sync trigger**: Automatically starts sync if data >5min old
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/cached/all` - All events with background refresh
  - `GET /api/cached/range?start=DATE&end=DATE` - Date range filtering
  - `GET /api/cached/day?date=DATE` - Single day events
  - `GET /api/cached/sync/status` - Sync statistics and health
  - `POST /api/cached/sync/trigger` - Manual sync (admin)
  - `POST /api/cached/events` - Add local events

**5. React CalendarCache Context (`src/client/lib/CalendarCache.tsx`)**
- **Zero-latency loading**: Instant UI updates with cached data
- **Optimistic updates**: Add/edit/delete events immediately in UI
- **Background refresh**: 30-second polling for external calendar changes
- **Smart caching**: Prevents redundant API calls, deduplicates events
- **Hooks**: `useCalendarCache()`, `useCachedEvents()`, `useDayEvents()`

**Performance Characteristics:**
- **Initial load**: 0ms (cached data served instantly)
- **User actions**: 0ms (optimistic updates)
- **External sync**: 30-60s background polling
- **API response time**: <10ms from MongoDB cache
- **Sync efficiency**: Only changed events transferred (via sync tokens)
- **Background sync**: 5-minute intervals, non-blocking

**Sync Token Implementation:**
- **iCloud**: Uses CalDAV `sync-collection` REPORT with server-provided sync tokens
- **Google**: Uses Calendar API `events.list` with `syncToken` parameter for incremental updates
- **Incremental updates**: Only fetches events modified since last sync token
- **Full sync fallback**: If sync token invalid/expired, performs complete calendar refresh
- **Change detection**: ETag comparison and last-modified timestamps for conflict resolution

**Database Indexes:**
- Event identity: `{ eventId: 1, provider: 1 }` (unique)
- Date queries: `{ start: 1, end: 1 }` for fast range searches
- Sync management: `{ syncedAt: 1 }`, `{ lastModified: 1 }`
- Calendar filtering: `{ calendarId: 1 }`, `{ deleted: 1 }`
- TTL cleanup: Auto-delete soft-deleted events after 30 days

**Error Handling:**
- **Sync failures**: Exponential backoff (5min → 60min max)
- **API rate limits**: Built-in delay and retry logic
- **Network issues**: Graceful degradation, cached data remains available
- **Data conflicts**: Last-write-wins with timestamp comparison
- **Invalid sync tokens**: Automatic full resync fallback

**Development Notes:**
- Background sync starts automatically on server init
- Sync tokens initialized from calendar configuration
- Compatible with Netlify serverless (no persistent processes required)
- Admin interface shows sync status, statistics, and manual controls
- Events are normalized across providers for consistent frontend interface

**Usage Examples:**
```typescript
// React component with instant loading
const { events, addEvent, isLoading } = useCachedEvents();

// Add event with immediate UI update
addEvent(newEvent); // Shows instantly in UI
// Background API call syncs to server

// Day-specific events
const { events: dayEvents } = useDayEvents(selectedDate);

// Manual sync trigger (admin)
const { triggerSync } = useCalendarCache();
await triggerSync(); // Forces immediate sync
```

**Monitoring & Admin:**
- `GET /api/cached/sync/status` - Health dashboard data
- Sync statistics: success rates, event counts, sync duration
- Error tracking: consecutive failures, last error messages  
- Calendar status: active/inactive, last sync timestamps
- Manual controls: force sync, reset sync tokens, full resync

- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates for add/edit/delete operations
- **Background Sync**: 30-second polling for external calendar changes
- **API Integration**: Uses `/api/cached/*` endpoints for data operations

### API Architecture Summary

**Primary Data Flow**:
1. **Background Sync**: CalendarSyncService syncs iCloud/Google → MongoDB cache
2. **Client Requests**: React components fetch from cache-first endpoints  
3. **Real-time Updates**: Optimistic updates + background sync for consistency
4. **Configuration Application**: All sync operations respect CalendarConfigModel settings

**Endpoint Categories**:
- **`/api/cached/*`** - MongoDB cache operations (primary data source)
- **`/api/merged/*`** - Unified calendar data (used by WeeklyCalendar)  
- **`/api/icloud/*`** - Direct iCloud operations (config, colors, admin actions)
- **`/api/google/*`** - Google Calendar integration
- **`/api/availability`** - Appointment slot calculation (cache-based)
- **`/api/calendar/schedule`** - Appointment creation with overlap checking
- **`/api/zoom/*`** - Meeting creation and management

**Recent Architecture Improvements**:
- ✅ Calendar configuration now properly applied during sync
- ✅ Availability endpoint optimized with MongoDB cache
- ✅ Timezone handling fixed (UTC storage → MT business hours)
- ✅ Zoom integration with OAuth authentication and auto-cleanup
- ✅ Event filtering respects calendar busy/blocking configuration

---

### iCloud Calendar Router (`backend/src/routes/icloud.ts`)

**Purpose:**
Fetch, parse, and serve iCloud calendar events (with RRULE expansion) for admin users, using a cache-first, background-update pattern. All endpoints require admin authentication and are Netlify/serverless compatible.

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/icloud/status` — Test iCloud connection and return calendar discovery status
- `GET /api/icloud/config` — Return all calendar configurations (both iCloud and Google calendars)
- `POST /api/icloud/config` — Update calendar busy/blocking status
- `GET /api/icloud/week?start=YYYY-MM-DD&end=YYYY-MM-DD` — Returns all events in the week range. Cache-first, background update.
- `GET /api/icloud/day?date=YYYY-MM-DD` — Returns all events for a single day. Cache-first, background update.
- `GET /api/icloud/month?year=YYYY&month=MM` — Returns all events for a month. Cache-first, background update.
- `GET /api/icloud/all` — Returns all events for the next 90 days. Cache-first, background update.

**Cache Pattern:**
- In-memory cache (per Netlify/serverless instance) keyed by query params.
- If cache hit: returns cached events immediately, triggers background refresh.
- If cache miss: fetches from iCloud, caches, and returns fresh events.

**Recent Fixes (Dec 2024):**
- Fixed calendar discovery by migrating from legacy tsdav `createDAVClient` to new `DAVClient` class
- Fixed event title extraction by handling `\r\n` line endings in iCal data
- Fixed recurring events by properly implementing RRULE expansion with rrule package
- Fixed calendar toggle behavior in config endpoint - now returns all calendars after updates
- Fixed frontend integration where calendars weren't showing due to API changes
- **Fixed calendar color system** - Now uses proper color priority: user override > fetched colors > stored colors > iOS-style defaults
- **Fixed PROPFIND TypeError** - Improved PROPFIND response structure handling for calendar-color properties
- **Fixed disappearing events** - Changed WeeklyCalendar filtering to show ALL configured calendars, not just busy ones
- **Fixed event color inheritance** - Events now properly inherit colors from their parent calendars in both iCloud and Google integrations
- **Fixed Google calendar dark colors** - Automatically brightens dark colors like `#202124` to ensure visibility
- **Eliminated generated fallback colors** - Removed random color generation in favor of curated iOS color palette
- **Fixed RRULE timezone expansion bug** - Root cause fix in rruleExpander.ts where DTSTART parsing now preserves original timezone context from iCal DTSTART;TZID=America/Denver fields instead of double-converting UTC times

**Current Status:**
- ✅ iCloud authentication working (7 calendars discovered)
- ✅ Event titles properly extracted from SUMMARY field
- ✅ Recurring events expanded correctly using RRULE
- ✅ Calendar configuration management working
- ✅ Calendar colors working with proper override system and iOS-style defaults
- ✅ Google calendar colors automatically brightened if too dark
- ✅ Color override system allows users to customize any calendar color
- ✅ Timezone handling working with Mountain Time default (configurable via admin)

**Reusable Utilities:**
- `getIcloudCreds()`: Returns Apple ID credentials from environment variables
- `createCacheKey(...args: string[])`: Generates a cache key from arguments
- `getCachedEvents(key: string)`: Returns cached events for a key, or null
- `setCachedEvents(key: string, events: any[], ttlSeconds = 300)`: Caches events for a key
- `parseICalDate(val: string)`: Parses iCal date strings to JS Date (handles YYYYMMDD and YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS formats)
- `parseICalEvents(objs: any[], from: Date, to: Date)`: Parses and expands iCal events including RRULE recurrence, extracts SUMMARY and UID with proper line ending handling
- `fetchAndCacheEvents(from: Date, to: Date, cacheKey: string)`: Fetches events from iCloud using DAVClient, parses with calendar metadata, and caches

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Uses tsdav v1.1.0+ `DAVClient` class (not legacy createDAVClient)
- Login required before calling `fetchCalendars()` or `fetchCalendarObjects()`
- RRULE expansion using `rrulestr` from rrule package for recurring events
- Event parsing handles `\r\n` line endings common in iCal data
- Calendar discovery works without props parameter (props parameter returns empty results)
- **RRULE timezone preservation**: Extracts original DTSTART;TZID from raw iCal data to prevent double timezone conversion during expansion

**Admin Auth:**
- All endpoints use `requireAdmin` middleware (checks `req.user.role === 'admin'`)

**Dependencies:**
- `tsdav` v1.1.0+ for CalDAV/iCloud access (DAVClient, DAVNamespace)
- `rrule` for recurrence expansion
- MongoDB CalendarConfigModel for calendar configuration storage

**TODO:**
- Implement proper CalDAV-based calendar color fetching using Apple CalDAV extensions
- Improve timezone handling to properly parse VTIMEZONE data from iCal files
- Add calendar color caching to reduce API calls

### DayEventsModal Component (`src/client/components/DayEventsModal.tsx`)

**Purpose:**
Modal overlay component that displays detailed day view with events from both iCloud and Google calendars. Uses React Portal for proper modal rendering and matches WeeklyCalendar structure with professional styling.

**Key Features:**
- **React Portal Implementation**: Renders as true modal overlay at document.body level using `createPortal`
- **Event Controls Panel**: Left sidebar (400px) with event list, business hours info, and quick actions
- **Mini Calendar View**: Right panel with scrollable 7am-9pm time grid showing precise event positioning
- **Navigation**: Previous/Next day buttons with optional `onNavigateDay` callback prop
- **Professional Styling**: Matches WeeklyCalendar design with proper modal overlay, backdrop blur, and consistent colors
- **Business Hours Integration**: Green/red horizontal lines for opening/closing times
- **Event Management**: Quick actions for marking busy/non-busy and deleting events
- **Synchronized Scrolling**: Time labels and calendar content scroll together for perfect alignment

**Props Interface:**
```typescript
interface DayEventsModalProps {
  day: number;
  month: number;
  year: number;
  events: CalendarEvent[];
  config: CalendarConfig | null;
  hours?: { [day: string]: { raw: string; startMinutes: number; endMinutes: number }; } | null;
  onClose: () => void;
  onConfigUpdate: () => void;
  onNavigateDay?: (direction: 'prev' | 'next') => void;
  footer?: React.ReactNode;
}
```

**Recent Fixes (Dec 2024):**
- **Fixed modal overlay rendering** - Now uses `createPortal(jsx, document.body)` to render at document root instead of inline
- **Fixed TypeScript interface** - Added optional `onNavigateDay` prop to match WeeklyCalendar usage
- **Fixed navigation functionality** - Proper callback handling for day navigation when parent provides handler
- **Maintained existing design** - Two-panel layout with event controls and mini calendar preserved
- **Fixed build optimization** - No longer generates scattered build artifacts in src folder
- **Fixed time alignment and scrolling** - Time labels now scroll with calendar content using unified scrollable container
- **Fixed border consistency** - Removed duplicate borders and aligned styling with WeeklyCalendar

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Modal displays as proper overlay using React Portal
- ✅ TypeScript compilation working without errors
- ✅ Professional styling matching WeeklyCalendar design
- ✅ Business hours lines working (green opening, red closing)
- ✅ Scrollable 7am-9pm time grid with synchronized time labels
- ✅ Event controls panel with quick actions
- ✅ Navigation buttons with callback support
- ✅ Perfect time alignment between labels and hour lines

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Synchronized Scrolling**: Uses nested grid containers where both time column and day content scroll together in unified container
- **Grid Layout Structure**: `display: 'grid', gridTemplateColumns: '80px 1fr'` for consistent alignment
- **Scroll Container**: Single scrollable div containing both time labels and calendar content to maintain perfect alignment
- **Border Management**: Consistent 1px borders matching WeeklyCalendar styling without duplication

**Dependencies:**
- `react` with `createPortal` from "react-dom"
- `calendar.module.css` for modal styling classes
- Parent component must provide event data and config
- Optional navigation callback for day switching

**Usage Example:**
```tsx
{selectedDay !== null && createPortal(
  <DayEventsModal
    day={selectedDay}
    month={currentMonth}
    year={currentYear}
    events={dayEvents}
    config={calendarConfig}
    hours={businessHours}
    onClose={() => setSelectedDay(null)}
    onConfigUpdate={handleConfigUpdate}
    onNavigateDay={(direction) => navigateToDay(direction)}
  />,
  document.body
)}
```

### ScheduleAppointmentModal Overlap Detection Fix (Dec 2024)

**Issue Fixed:**
The ScheduleAppointmentModal was showing false "overlap" warnings when users selected pre-validated available time slots from the availability API. The component was also not correctly detecting real overlaps when users entered custom times.

**Root Cause:**
The overlap detection logic was running for both selected time slots (which are already validated as non-overlapping by the backend) and custom time entries, causing false positives.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Conditional Overlap Checking**: Only run overlap detection when user manually enters a custom time (`selectedSlot` is null)
- **Available Slot Protection**: When a user selects from available slots, skip overlap detection entirely since backend guarantees these are non-overlapping
- **Improved Event Filtering**: Only check overlap against blocking events (`ev.blocking !== false`)
- **Proper Timezone Conversion**: Events from API (UTC) converted to Mountain Time for comparison with user input

**Key Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Only check for overlaps when user manually enters a custom time
if (selectedSlot) {
  setOverlapWarning(null);
  return;
}

const overlap = events.find(ev => {
  // Skip non-blocking events
  if (ev.blocking === false) return false;
  
  // Convert UTC events to local timezone for comparison
  const evStart = DateTime.fromISO(ev.start).setZone(TIMEZONE);
  const evEnd = ev.end ? DateTime.fromISO(ev.end).setZone(TIMEZONE) : evStart.plus({ minutes: 30 });
  
  return (start < evEnd && end > evStart);
});
```

**Dependencies:**
- `selectedSlot` state tracks which available slot is selected
- `/api/icloud/day` provides events for overlap checking
- Luxon DateTime for timezone conversions
- `useEffect` dependency on `selectedSlot` prevents false warnings

**Final Fix (Dec 2024):**
Fixed the root cause of false overlap warnings by correcting timezone interpretation in overlap detection. The issue was that events from the API were being double-converted from UTC to Mountain Time, causing "Mgt 5850" at 12:25 PM to appear as 6:25 AM in overlap calculations.

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Correct approach: Parse API times as local Mountain Time (remove Z suffix)
const evStartStr = ev.start.replace('Z', '');
const evStart = DateTime.fromISO(evStartStr, { zone: TIMEZONE });
```

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Available time slots no longer show false overlap warnings
- ✅ Custom time entries use correct timezone interpretation
- ✅ Events at 12:25 PM no longer cause false overlaps with 6:30 AM appointments
- ✅ Calendar display and overlap detection now use consistent timezone logic
- ✅ Only blocking events cause overlap warnings

### Build System Optimizations (Dec 2024)

**Root TypeScript Configuration (`tsconfig.json`):**
- **Modern ESM setup**: ES2022 target with bundler module resolution
- **Type checking only**: `noEmit: true` - compilation handled by build tools
- **Universal coverage**: Includes all TypeScript files in project
- **Clean excludes**: Excludes dist, node_modules, and backup files

**Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`):**
- **Clean builds**: `emptyOutDir: true` ensures dist folder is cleaned before each build
- **Code splitting**: Separate chunks for React vendor libs and date utilities
- **Performance optimizations**: ESNext target, esbuild minification, sourcemaps disabled for production
- **Asset optimization**: 4KB inline limit, CSS code splitting enabled
- **Dependency pre-bundling**: React, React-DOM, date-fns optimized for faster dev server startup

**Rollup Configuration (`rollup.config.mjs`):**
- **ESM compilation**: Compiles TypeScript server files to proper ESM with `.js` extensions
- **Module preservation**: Uses `preserveModules: true` to maintain file structure
- **External dependencies**: Marks all node_modules and built-ins as external
- **Glob pattern inputs**: Uses `globSync("src/server/**/*.ts")` for automatic file discovery, eliminating manual maintenance
- **Smart filtering**: Excludes `.d.ts` and `.test.ts` files automatically

**Package Scripts:**
- `build`: Full build using `tsc` (type checking) + `vite build` (client) + `rollup` (server)
- `start`: Production server with `NODE_ENV=production node dist/server/index.js`
- `start:dev`: Development server using `tsx` for direct TypeScript execution
- `build:netlify`: Full production build with compression
- `compress`: Creates gzipped versions of JS and CSS files
- `analyze`: Bundle size analysis for optimization

**Netlify Deployment (`netlify.toml`):**
- **SPA routing**: Wildcard redirect to index.html for client-side routing
- **Aggressive caching**: 1-year cache for assets, revalidation for HTML
- **Security headers**: XSS protection, content-type enforcement, referrer policy
- **Compression**: Pre-gzip assets for optimal transfer speeds
- **Resource preloading**: Critical CSS and JS files preloaded in HTML headers

**Recent Fixes (Dec 2024):**
- ✅ All build artifacts now go to `dist/` folder only
- ✅ No scattered `.js`, `.d.ts`, `.map` files in `src/` folders
- ✅ TypeScript configuration prevents source pollution with `noEmit: true`
- ✅ Rollup properly compiles server TypeScript to ESM with correct `.js` extensions
- ✅ Server runs successfully in production with proper ESM module resolution
- ✅ Optimized chunk splitting reduces bundle sizes
- ✅ Netlify configuration enables maximum performance
- ✅ Glob wildcard patterns eliminate manual file listing maintenance
- ✅ Calendar border issues fixed - removed timeColumn border-right to prevent doubling with dayColumn borders
- ✅ Day modal time alignment fixed - time labels now scroll synchronously with calendar content
- ✅ All-day section border consistency - removed duplicate border-bottom from allDayTimeColumn

**Calendar Component Border Fixes:**
- **timeColumn Border Removal**: Removed `border-right: 1px solid #1e1e24` from `.timeColumn` to prevent doubling with `.dayColumn` borders
- **allDayTimeColumn Border Fix**: Removed `border-bottom: 1px solid #1e1e24` from `.allDayTimeColumn` to prevent doubling with wrapper borders
- **Consistent Visual Hierarchy**: All calendar components now share identical border thickness and styling patterns
- **Day Modal Alignment**: Restructured DayEventsModal to use unified scrolling container ensuring perfect time label alignment with hour grid lines

**Build Performance:**
- Client build: ~535ms with optimized dependencies
- Server build: ~5.6s with Rollup ESM compilation
- Asset sizes: 147KB main bundle, 142KB React vendor (gzipped ~46KB each)
- Clean separation: Client assets in `dist/client/`, server in `dist/server/`

**Key Technical Solutions:**
- **ESM Import Resolution**: Rollup automatically adds `.js` extensions to compiled imports
- **Module Resolution**: Uses `bundler` mode for TypeScript with proper external handling
- **Production Server**: Automatically starts when `NODE_ENV=production` is set
- **Development Workflow**: Uses `tsx` for direct TypeScript execution in development

### Fixed Availability Endpoint (`backend/src/routes/availability-simple.ts`)

**Purpose:**
Fast, accurate calculation of available appointment slots using MongoDB cached events. Architecture completely rewritten (Dec 2024) to use the cached router instead of direct iCloud API calls.

**Endpoint:**
- `GET /api/availability?date=YYYY-MM-DD&duration=MINUTES&buffer=MINUTES` — Returns available appointment slots

**Current Architecture (Fixed Dec 2024):**
- **MongoDB Cache First**: Uses CachedEventModel directly for instant event retrieval
- **All-Day Event Exclusion**: Filters out all-day events from blocking appointments
- **UTC Storage Handling**: Events stored in UTC, properly converted to Mountain Time for business hour comparison
- **Timezone Aware**: Business hours in Mountain Time, events converted from UTC storage
- **Blocking Filter**: Only considers events where `blocking !== false`

**Performance:**
- **Response Time**: ~10-50ms (direct MongoDB query)
- **No External API Calls**: Uses cached events exclusively
- **Business Hours**: 7 AM - 5 PM Mountain Time (configurable)

**Current Status (Dec 2024):**
- ✅ Architecture simplified to use MongoDB cache exclusively
- ✅ Timezone handling fixed for UTC storage → MT business hours
- ✅ All-day events properly excluded from blocking
- ✅ Event filtering correctly respects calendar configuration
- ✅ **Calendar Sync Fixed**: CalendarSyncService now properly applies blocking/color config during sync
- ✅ **Result**: Now correctly returns 7 available slots for test dates (previously showed 20+ incorrect slots)

**Major Fix Applied (Dec 2024):**
Fixed CalendarSyncService to respect calendar configuration instead of hardcoding blocking status:
```typescript
// Before: All events hardcoded as blocking
blocking: true

// After: Configuration-aware blocking
const config = await CalendarConfigModel.findOne();
const isBlocking = config?.busyCalendars?.includes(calendarUrl) || false;
blocking: isBlocking
```

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// Current implementation uses direct MongoDB query with proper filtering
const events = await CachedEventModel.find({
  deleted: { $ne: true },
  allDay: { $ne: true }, // Exclude all-day events
  blocking: { $ne: false }, // Only blocking events
  $or: [/* date range queries */]
}).lean();
```

**Dependencies:**
- `CachedEventModel` for MongoDB event storage
- `CalendarSyncService` for proper event sync with configuration
- `dayjs` with UTC and timezone plugins
- Mountain Time timezone (`America/Denver`)

**See also:**
- CachedEventModel (MongoDB schema)
- CalendarSyncService (properly applies calendar configuration)
- Cached router (/api/cached/day) for event retrieval
