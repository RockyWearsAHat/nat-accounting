Website theme: Black and White, Modern, Minamilistic, Luxury looking

This is how I want my website layout to be: [LINK]https://www.sagiagency.com/clutch/?utm_source=clutch.co&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=featured-listing-consulting-us

There should be
Free consultation:

Requiring:

Company
Website if applicable

Intake questionnaire (checkboxes/inputs):
Duns Number
Number of Subsidiaries if services needed for
Revenue approx
If they want bookkeeping services approximately how many transactions per month
If they want reconciliations, how many accounts?
Do they need assistance doing a financial clean up?
Do they need assistance with accounting software implementation?
What are their goals?
Do you need assistance creating a website yes/no?

Create a zoom scheduler that sets up meetings for these requested consultations automatically within my working hours (specified within hoursOfOperation.json) cross referenced with my personal calender & already scheduled appointments for available time slots, send an email notification to mayrconsultingservices@gmail.com, schedule a block on my personal calendar, and preferably send a SMS message notification. If they want to reach me by phone I will create google voice eventually.

Pricing guidelines do not include on website. I must give this because it all depends on the company and the services they requested dependant on their size. This site will probably need an admin interface so I can view sensitive company information without the fear of it being leaked.

Small Business (<$2M revenue): Usually fewer than 10 employees, lower invoice/payment volume (<100 monthly), and basic reporting needs.

Mid-Tier ($2M–$20M revenue): 10–100 employees, higher transaction volume (100–500+ invoices/month), more complex reporting, may need multi-entity or consolidated financials.

DEPENDING ON THE INFORMATION THE CLIENT ANSWERED GIVE ME AN ESTIMATE OF THE COST AND A BREAKOWN OF ALL SERVICES NECESSARY, IDEALLY IT'D BE NICE TO ALSO HAVE AN ADMIN INTERFACE TO VIEW ALL THIS INFORMATION.

How to Present on Your Website
Instead of only listing hourly/monthly rates, bundle services into tiered packages:
Starter (Small Business Focus): Basic bookkeeping + reconciliations + monthly financials (DON'T DISPLAY PRICE BUT DEPENDING ON SERVICES NEEDED ESTIMATE $750–$1,200/month).

Growth (Mid-Tier Focus): Full bookkeeping + AR/AP outsourcing + advisory check-in (AGAIN DO NOT DISPLAY THE PRICE BUT DEPENDING ON SERVICES NEEDED ESTIMATE BETWEEN $2,000–$3,500/month).

Premium (CFO Lite): Everything in Growth + forecasting + KPI dashboards + quarterly strategy sessions (ONCE AGAIN, THIS IS INTERNAL, DO NOT DISPLAY THE PRICES TO THE CUSTOMER THIS IS TO DRAW PEOPLE IN NOT CLOSE A DEAL, BUT FOR ADMINS ESTIMATE AROUND $3,500–$5,000+/month DEPENDING ON SERVICES).

Professionalize this site, make it clean, interesting, and very helpful to the end user and additionally me as the admin.
